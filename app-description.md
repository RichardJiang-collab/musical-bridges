App Description:
Musical Bridges is an innovative web application designed to help users navigate and manage their emotions through the power of music. Our app integrates with Spotify to create personalized playlists based on the user's current emotional state and intensity.
Key features of Musical Bridges include:

Emotion-based playlist generation: Users select their current emotion (e.g., angry or sad) and its intensity (normal or intense). The app then leverages Spotify's API to curate a playlist tailored to that emotional state.
Mood transition: Playlists are designed not just to match the current emotion but to guide users towards a more positive emotional state.
Top track recommendations: The app analyzes the generated playlist and recommends the top 5 tracks that best fit the user's emotional needs.
Interactive user interface: A clean, intuitive interface allows users to easily navigate through emotion selection and view their personalized playlists.
Spotify integration: Users can listen to full tracks and playlists directly within the app using Spotify's embedded player.

Musical Bridges is designed for anyone looking to use music as a tool for emotional regulation and well-being. It enables users to:

Explore the connection between their emotions and music
Discover new songs that resonate with their current emotional state
Use music as a means of emotional support and mood enhancement
Easily access and play Spotify content tailored to their emotional needs

By integrating with Spotify, we leverage its vast music library and powerful API to provide a unique, emotionally intelligent music experience that goes beyond traditional playlist creation.
